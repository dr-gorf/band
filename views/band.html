      Dr. GORF was originally created as a side project of Chris Jellison (known for <i>Hello Geno</i>, <i>8bit My Head</i>) and Kevin Albert (nothing noteworthy) in 2006.
      Our style is always changing, but our core philosophy remains the same:
      <strong><i>The very best music is recorded at 3 in the morning, in one take.</i></strong>

      This is Chris. He's from Santa Cruz, CA. Chris writes most of our lyrics, and shreds any instrument with keys.
      Aside from Dr. GORF, Chris has produced a number of chiptune albums on his own.

      His pants have been known to rip onstage, but that has never slowed him down.

      Hailing from Royal Oaks, CA, Kevin composes most of our music and plays guitar here and there.
      He once recorded a riff in 47/16.

      Kevin is best known for spontaneously having really good hair days.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
      The first album - the electronic epic "Program 9" - was very poorly received. Regardless, Dr. GORF continued to create, and developed its style.

      Dr. GORF recorded their acapella EP the following year. It was released exclusively on MySpace, and has since been lost. If you find it please let us know.
      </p>
      <p>
      In December 2008, the holiday album "A Christmas Something" was released, combining the signature acapella style with real and synthesized instruments.
      Afterwards, Dr GORF stopped releasing music in lieu of writing and performing acapella jingles called "crimps" (inspired by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/mightyboosh/">these guys</a>), and occasionally recorded songs but did not distribute them.
      </p>
      <p>
      Almost 8 years later, Dr GORF began work on "Classic Times, Crazy Days", a compilation of singles recorded after "A Christmas Something" and new content. 
      It is sheduled to be released in Spring 2016.
