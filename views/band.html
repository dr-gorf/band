      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
      Dr. GORF was created as a side project of Chris Jellison (known for <i>Hello Geno</i>, <i>8bit My Head</i>) and Kevin Albert (nothing noteworthy) in 2006. The first album - the electronic epic Program 9 - was very poorly received. Regardless, Dr. GORF continued to create, and developed its core philosophy: The very best music is recorded in one take at 3 in the morning.

      Dr. GORF recorded the acapella EP the following year. It was released exclusively on MySpace, and has since been lost. If you find it please let us know.

      <p>
      In December 2008, the holiday album "A Christmas Something" was released, combining the signature acapella style with real and synthesized instruments. Afterwards, Dr GORF stopped releasing music in lieu of writing and performing acapella jingles called "crimps" (inspired by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/mightyboosh/">these guys</a>), and occasionally recorded songs but did not distribute them
      </p>
      <p>
      Almost 8 years later, Dr GORF began work on "Classic Times, Crazy Days", a compilation of singles recorded after "A Christmas Something" and new content. It is sheduled to be released in Spring 2016.

      This is Chris. He's from Santa Cruz. Chris writes most of our lyrics, and shreds any instrument with keys.
      Aside from Dr GORF, Chris has produced a number of chiptune albums on his own.
      His pants have been known to rip onstage. That has never slowed him down.

      <h2>Influences</h2>
      <p>
      We have always been fans of progressive metal, chiptune music, and pretty much anything that sounds cool. 
      The Mighty Boosh introduced us to crimping and showed us that there is even weirder music than ours out there.
